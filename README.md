# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe by Linari Luca

Welcome to my **Tic Tac Toe** project — a simple implementation of the classic game, adapted specifically for **macOS** users.

---

## 🧩 About the Project

In this project, I developed a Tic Tac Toe game using the **Tkinter** library.  
The special feature of this version is that it addresses a **macOS compatibility issue**:  
> On macOS, Tkinter does not allow the background color of a single button to be changed correctly.

To work around this, I implemented a solution that **colors the button's border instead of its background**.
