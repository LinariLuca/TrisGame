#TIC TAC TOE BY LINARI LUCA

Project in which I went to create the game of tic-tac-toe, the special feature being that I adapted this version for users of the MacOS operating system, as I wanted to use the tkinter library.
The latter does not allow the function of filling the colour of a single button to work properly, but in this case I got around the problem by colouring the outline of the button and not the inside of it directly.

For any doubts or requests for collaboration on other projects (even considerably larger than this one), I remain at your disposal at the following e-mail address: luca.linari@gmail.com
